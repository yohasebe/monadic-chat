## About

🌟 **Monadic Chat** is a highly configurable web application framework for creating and using intelligent chatbots, leveraging the power of OpenAI's Chat and Whisper APIs and the Ruby programming language.

## Features

### Basic Structure

- 🤖 Powered by **GPT-3.5** or **GPT-4** via OpenAI's Chat API, with unlimited conversation turns
- 👩‍💻 Easy installation using **Docker** for Mac, Windows, or Linux

### Data Management

- 💾 **Export/import** messages functionality
- 💬 Specify the number of recent messages (**active messages**) to send to the API, while storing and exporting older messages (**inactive messages**)
- 🔢 Generate **text embeddings** from data in multiple **PDF files** and query their content using OpenAI's text embedding API

### Voice Interaction

- 🎙️ Automatic transcription of **microphone input** using OpenAI's Whisper API
- 🔈 **Text-to-speech** functionality for AI assistant responses
- 🗣️ Choose the **language and voice** for text-to-speech (available on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge)
- 🗺️ **Automatic language detection** for appropriate text-to-speech playback
- 😊 Enable **voice conversations** with the AI agent using speech recognition and text-to-speech

### Configuration and Extension

- 💡 Customize the AI agent's behavior by specifying **API parameters** and the **system prompt**
- 💎 Extend functionality using the **Ruby** programming language

### Message Editing

- 📝 **Edit** previous messages and retry when the desired AI agent response is not obtained
- 🗑️ **Delete** specific messages from previous conversations
- 📜 **Add** preceding messages with user, assistant, or system roles

### Advanced

- 🪄 Obtain additional information alongside the primary AI assistant response and store it as the **conversation state** in a predefined JSON object

## Installation

See [Setting up Monadic Chat](https://yohasebe.github.io/monadic-chat-web/setup)

## Base Apps

Currently, the following base apps are available for use. By selecting one of them and changing the parameters or rewriting the initial prompt, you can adjust the behavior of the AI agent. You can export/import the adjusted settings to/from an external JSON file.

### Chat

<img src="./assets/icons/chat.png" width="40px"/> This is the standard application for monadic chat. It can be used in basically the same way as ChatGPT.

### Language Practice

<img src="./assets/icons/language-practice.png" width="40px"/> This is a language learning application where conversations begin with the assistant's speech. The assistant's speech is played back in a synthesized voice. To speak, press the Enter key to start speech input, and press Enter again to stop speech input.

### Language Practice Plus

<img src="./assets/icons/language-practice-plus.png" width="40px"/> This is a language learning application where conversations start with the assistant’s speech. The assistant’s speech is played back in a synthesized voice. To speak, press the Enter key to start speech input, and press Enter again to stop speech input. The assistant’s response will include linguistic advice in addition to the usual content. The language advice is presented only as text and not as text-to-speech.

### Novel

<img src="./assets/icons/novel.png" width="40px"/> This is an application for collaboratively writing a novel with an assistant. The assistant writes a paragraph summarizing the theme, topic, or event presented in the prompt. Always use the same language as the assistant in your response.

### PDF Navigator

<img src="./assets/icons/pdf-navigator.png" width="40px"/> This is an application that reads a PDF file, and the assistant answers the user's questions based on its content. First, click on the "Upload PDF" button and specify the file. The content of the file will be divided into segments of approximately max_tokens length, and the text embedding will be calculated for each segment. When input is received from the user, the text segment that is closest to the text embedding value of the input text is given to GPT along with the user's input value, and an answer is generated based on that content.

### Translate

<img src="./assets/icons/translate.png" width="40px"/> The assistant will translate the user's input text into another language. First, the assistant will ask for the target language. Then, the input text will be translated into the target language. If you want the assistant to use a specific translation, please put parentheses after the relevant part of the input text and specify the translation in the parentheses.

### Voice Chat

<img src="./assets/icons/voice-chat.png" width="40px"/> This app enables users to chat using voice through OpenAI’s Whisper API and the browser’s text-to-speech API. The initial prompt is the same as the one for the Chat app. Please note that a web browser with the latter API, such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, is required.

### Wikipedia

<img src="./assets/icons/wikipedia.png" width="40px"/> This is essentially the same as Chat, but for questions that GPT cannot answer, such as questions about events that occurred after the language model cutoff time, it searches Wikipedia to answer them. If the query is in a non-English language, the Wikipedia search is performed in English, and the results are translated into the original language.

### Linguistic Analysis

<img src="./assets/icons/linguistic-analysis.png" width="40px"/> This app utilizes Monadic Chat’s feature that allows for updating a pre-specified JSON object with multiple properties while providing a regular response. As the main response to the user’s query, it returns a syntactic structure of the input sentence. In the process, the app updates the values of the JSON object with the properties of `topic`, `sentence_type`, and `sentiment`.
