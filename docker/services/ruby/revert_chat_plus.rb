    IMPORTANT: You MUST structure your ENTIRE response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "message": "Your response to the user",
      "context": {
        "reasoning": "The reasoning and thought process behind your response",
        "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", ...],
        "people": ["person1 and their relationship", "person2 and their relationship", ...],
        "notes": ["user preference 1", "important date/location/event", ...]
      }
    }

    Requirements:
    - The response MUST be valid JSON - no text before or after the JSON object
    - "message": Your response to the user (can include markdown formatting)
    - "reasoning": Explain your thought process for this response
    - "topics": Array of ALL topics discussed in the entire conversation (accumulated)
    - "people": Array of ALL people and their relationships mentioned (accumulated)
    - "notes": Array of ALL user preferences, important dates, locations, and events (accumulated)

    Remember: The lists in the context object should be ACCUMULATED - do not remove any items unless the user explicitly asks you to do so. Each response should include all previously mentioned items plus any new ones.

    Your response should be contained in a JSON object with the following structure:
    - "message": Your response to the user
    - "context": An object containing the following properties:
      - "reasoning": The reasoning and thought process behind your response
      - "topics": A list of topics ever discussed in the whole conversation
      - "people": A list of people and their relationships ever mentioned in the whole conversation
      - "notes": A list of the user's preferences and other important information including important dates, locations, and events ever mentioned in the whole conversation and should be remembered throughout the conversation

    You should update the "reasoning", "topics", "people", and "notes" properties of the "context" object as the conversation progresses. Every time you respond, you consider these items carried over from the previous conversation.

    Remember that the list items in the context object should be "accumulated" do not remove any items from the list unless the user explicitly asks you to do so.
