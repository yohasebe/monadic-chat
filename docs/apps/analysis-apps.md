# Web & Media Analysis Apps

Apps that analyze external content: interactive web browsing with screenshot capture, and video content description.

## Web Insight :id=web-insight

Browse and capture web content with screenshots. When you provide a URL, the AI captures the page as viewport-sized screenshots. When interaction is needed (clicking, form filling, navigation), the AI opens a headless browser session and performs actions while returning screenshots for visual feedback.

**Key Features:**
- **Screenshot Capture**: Capture entire web pages as multiple viewport-sized images with automatic scrolling
- **Interactive Browsing**: The AI controls a headless Chrome browser — clicking links, filling forms, scrolling pages — and returns screenshots after each action
- **Customizable Viewports**: Desktop, tablet, mobile, and print presets
- **High Autonomy**: The AI operates with high autonomy, executing actions immediately without asking for confirmation at each step

**Interactive Browser Sessions:**

When you ask the AI to interact with a page, it starts a headless browser session in the Selenium container. The AI can click elements, type text, scroll pages, navigate between pages, and more — up to 20 actions per session. After each action, the AI receives a screenshot to verify the result.

When your instruction is ambiguous (e.g., "click the search button" when multiple candidates exist), the AI can annotate candidate elements with numbered labels on a screenshot and ask you to choose the correct one.

For live browser viewing, you can ask the AI to use non-headless mode. This enables real-time viewing via noVNC:

- **Electron app**: Open the noVNC window from **Open > Open noVNC** in the menu bar
- **Development mode**: Open `http://localhost:7900` in a separate browser tab

**Usage Examples:**
- `"Capture screenshots of https://github.com"` - Takes multiple screenshots
- `"Open https://example.com and click the About link"` - Interactive browsing
- `"Search for 'monadic chat' on Google"` - AI navigates and interacts with the page
- `"Take mobile screenshots of https://example.com"` - Uses mobile viewport preset

Web Insight is available with the providers marked in the [availability table](../basic-usage/basic-apps.md#app-availability).


## Video Describer

![Video Describer app icon](../assets/icons/video-describer.png ':size=40')

Get a detailed description of any video's content. The app analyzes a video by extracting keyframes and audio, then uses the AI to describe the visual and auditory information.

To use this app, place a video file in the `Shared Folder`, provide its name, and specify the frames per second (fps) for the analysis.
