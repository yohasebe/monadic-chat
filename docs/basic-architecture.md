# Basic Architecture

Monadic Chat provides advanced features that cannot be achieved with just the language model API by incorporating a virtual environment built as a Docker container into the system.

Both users and AI agents can access the Docker container, allowing them to collaborate through natural language communication to bring about changes in the environment. Specifically, under the user's instructions, the AI agent can install commands, learn how to use them, execute commands, and return results.

It also provides a mechanism for sharing data between the host computer and individual Docker containers. This allows users to seamlessly collaborate with the virtual environment, providing necessary files to the AI agent and retrieving files generated by the AI agent.

# Standard Docker Containers

This section explains the standard Docker containers available in Monadic Chat.  By default, the following containers are built:

**Ruby Container** (`monadic-chat-ruby-container`)
This container is necessary to run Monadic Chat applications. It is also used to provide the web interface.

**Python Container** (`monadic-chat-python-container`)
This container is used to run Python scripts that extend the functionality of Monadic Chat. JupyterLab also runs on this container.

Apps that use this container include: `Code Interpreter`, `Jupyter Notebook`, `Video Describer`

**Selenium Container** (`monadic-chat-selenium-container`)
This container is used to operate a virtual web browser using Selenium for web scraping.

Apps that use this container include: `Code Interpreter`, `Content Reader`

**pgvector Container** (`monadic-chat-pgvector-container`)
This container is used to store text embedding vector data on PostgreSQL for using pgvector.  For more information on adding Docker containers, see [Adding Docker Containers](./adding-containers.md).

Apps that use this container include: `PDF Navigator`

You can install new software on a Docker container or edit files to extend the functionality of Monadic Chat.
