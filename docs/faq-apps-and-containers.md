# FAQ: Apps and Containers

**Q**: I installed the Ollama plugin and downloaded a model, but it is not reflected in the web interface. What should I do?

**A**: It may take some time for the model downloaded to the Ollama container to be loaded and become available. Wait a while and then reload the web interface. If the downloaded model still does not appear, access the Ollama container from the terminal and run the `ollama list` command to check if the downloaded model is displayed in the list. If it is not displayed, run the `ollama reload` command to reload the Ollama plugin.
