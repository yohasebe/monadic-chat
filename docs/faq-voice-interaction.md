# FAQ: Voice Interaction

**Q**: Sometimes the text is played back in a different language than the actual language during speech synthesis. What should I do?

**A**: The `Automatic-Speech-Recognition (ASR) Language` selector on the web interface is set to `Automatic` by default. By setting it to a specific language, the text will be played back in the specified language during speech synthesis.

**Q**: Can I save the input text as an MP3 file by synthesizing speech?

**A**: Yes, you can save the synthesized speech as a file by selecting the `Speech Draft Helper` app, entering the text, and instructing the AI agent to convert it to an MP3 file.

**Q**: Can I have a voice conversation with the AI agent?

**A**: Yes, you can. Enable both `Auto speech` and `Easy submit` in the `Chat Interaction Controls` on the web interface. You can start and complete voice message input by pressing the Enter key (without clicking a button). Also, when the input is complete, the message is automatically sent, and the synthesized voice of the response from the AI agent is played. In other words, you can have a voice conversation with the AI agent just by pressing the Enter key at the right time.
