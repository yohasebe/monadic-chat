**Q**: Do I need an OpenAI API token to use Monadic Chat?

**A**: Yes, an OpenAI API token is required not only for AI chat but also for speech recognition, speech synthesis, and creating text embeddings. Even if you mainly use APIs other than OpenAI for chat, such as Anthropic's Claude, an OpenAI API token is still necessary.
