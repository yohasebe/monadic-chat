## Getting Started & Requirements

### Q: Do I need an OpenAI API token to use Monadic Chat? :id=api-token-requirement

**A**: No, an OpenAI API token is not mandatory. You have several options:

- **Ollama Plugin**: Use completely free, open-source models running locally
- **Other Providers**: Use Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Cohere, or other providers instead
- **Limited Features**: Some features work without any API tokens (basic UI exploration)

However, for the best experience with features like speech recognition and help system, an OpenAI API key is recommended.

### Q: What happens if I install a new version? :id=version-updates

**A**: When installing a new version:
- User settings (API tokens, configurations) are preserved
- Docker containers may rebuild based on changes
- Full rebuild occurs if Dockerfiles change
- Otherwise, only the Ruby container rebuilds (faster)

### Q: Can I use Monadic Chat offline? :id=offline-usage

**A**: Yes, with limitations:
- **Ollama models** work completely offline
- **Web search** and cloud-based features require internet
- **Local containers** continue working without internet
- **API-based models** need internet connection

- **Speech**: Play as speech (when available)
- **Stop**: Stop speech playback
- **Delete**: Remove entire message
- **Edit**: Modify message content
- **Active/Inactive**: Toggle context inclusion

Hold Shift while clicking Copy for plain text instead of Markdown.

### Q: How are tokens calculated? :id=token-counting

**A**: Token counts shown include:
- Message content
- System prompts
- Context window
- Tool definitions
- Special formatting

The count updates dynamically and helps track API usage.

### Q: What is the Role selector for? :id=role-selector

**A**: The Role selector (User/Assistant/System) allows:
- **User**: Normal user messages
- **Assistant**: Simulate AI responses
- **System**: Add system-level instructions

Useful for testing, examples, or conversation templates.

### Q: Why do I see localhost security warnings? :id=localhost-warning

**A**: Browser warnings about localhost are normal:
- Monadic Chat serves UI locally
- No external server connection
- Data stays on your machine
- Warning can be safely ignored

---

## Configuration & Advanced Usage

### Q: How do I run Monadic Chat in server mode? :id=server-mode

**A**: Server mode allows multiple users:

1. Set `DISTRIBUTED_MODE=true` in config
2. Run `rake server`
3. Access from browser at server IP
4. Each user needs their own API keys
5. Sessions are isolated

### Q: Can I add Python libraries? :id=add-python-libraries

**A**: Yes, two methods:

**Method 1** - Custom setup script:
```bash
# ~/monadic/config/pysetup.sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

**Method 2** - In-app installation:
```python
!pip install library_name
```

Changes persist across container restarts with Method 1.

### Q: How do I enable LaTeX apps (Concept Visualizer / Syntax Tree)? :id=enable-latex

**A**: Open `Actions → Install Options…` and enable LaTeX. These apps also require an OpenAI or Anthropic API key; otherwise they remain hidden.

### Q: Why are “From URL / #doc” buttons hidden? :id=url-doc-hidden

**A**: When Selenium is disabled and no Tavily API key is configured, these buttons are hidden. If Selenium is disabled but a Tavily key exists, “From URL” uses Tavily. Enable Selenium to restore the original Selenium-based path.

### Q: Where can I find rebuild logs and health results? :id=rebuild-logs

**A**: Saving options no longer triggers a rebuild automatically. Run Rebuild from the main console when ready. Files are saved under `~/monadic/log/build/python/<timestamp>/`:
- `docker_build.log`, `post_install.log`, `health.json`, `meta.json`

### Q: Rebuilds are slow. How can I speed them up? :id=rebuild-speed

**A**: The Dockerfile is layer-split for caching (base vs optional libs). To maximize cache hits:
- Avoid changing many options at once; only modified layers rebuild
- Ensure Docker build cache is enabled
- Keep `pysetup.sh` lightweight; heavy installs will dominate time
- Stable network speeds significantly affect pip/apt install times

### Q: What happens if a rebuild fails? :id=rebuild-failure

**A**: The current image is preserved (atomic update). Check the latest per-run folder for logs, fix issues (e.g., `~/monadic/config/pysetup.sh`), and retry.

### Q: When does the Ruby container rebuild run? Can I avoid frequent rebuilds? :id=ruby-rebuild-when

**A**: Ruby rebuilds only when necessary.
- At startup, Monadic Chat probes orchestration health; if Ruby isn’t ready to coordinate updated containers, it performs a one-time, cache-friendly refresh.
- Separately, if Gem dependencies changed (fingerprint = SHA256 of `Gemfile` + `monadic.gemspec`), Ruby is refreshed. The bundle layer is reused via Docker cache whenever possible.
- To force a clean rebuild for diagnostics, set `FORCE_RUBY_REBUILD_NO_CACHE=true` in `~/monadic/config/env`.

### Q: After clicking Stop, the web UI alternates between “Connecting…” and “Connection lost”. :id=stop-connecting-flicker

**A**: Intentional stops suppress noisy reconnect attempts in the embedded browser. The status shows “Stopped” during shutdown. If a tab was left open externally, refresh it after the next Start.

### Q: Do NLTK and spaCy options also download datasets/models automatically? :id=nltk-spacy-auto

**A**: No. The options install packages only to keep images lean.
- NLTK: install library only; datasets are not auto-downloaded.
- spaCy: install `spacy==3.7.5`; language models (e.g., `en_core_web_sm`, `en_core_web_lg`) are not auto-downloaded.
- Use `~/monadic/config/pysetup.sh` to fetch datasets/models during post-setup. See Python container docs for an example snippet.

### Q: How do I customize TTS pronunciation? :id=tts-dictionary

**A**: Create a pronunciation dictionary:

1. Create CSV file (no headers)
2. Format: `original,pronunciation`
3. Save to `~/monadic/data/`
4. Set path in TTS settings

Example:
```
AI,ay eye
SQL,sequel
```

### Q: What is MCP and how do I use it? :id=mcp-integration

**A**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables:
- External AI assistants to use Monadic Chat tools
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
- Enable with `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=true`
- Automatic tool discovery
- See [MCP Integration docs](/advanced-topics/mcp-integration.md)

4. **First Launch**
   - Initial container download takes time
   - Watch progress in console

### Q: What if containers fail to build? :id=container-build-failure

**A**: Troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   docker logs monadic-chat-ruby-container
   ```

2. **Clean Rebuild**
   - Delete containers in Docker Desktop
   - Restart Monadic Chat

3. **Disk Space**
   - Ensure 15GB+ free space

### Q: What if code execution fails repeatedly? :id=code-execution-errors

**A**: Code Interpreter has retry mechanisms:
- Automatic error detection
- Up to 3 retry attempts
- Self-correction for common issues
- If persistent, check:
  - Python package availability
  - Memory limits
  - Code syntax errors

### Q: Can I have multiple conversations in parallel? :id=multiple-conversations

## Need More Help?

- Use **Monadic Help** app for AI-powered assistance
- Check [documentation](/) for detailed guides
- Review [configuration reference](/reference/configuration.md)
- See [quick start tutorial](/getting-started/quick-start.md) for basics
### Q: I rebuilt the Python or user containers and then Start failed. Do I need to rebuild Ruby too?

**A**: The Start command performs an orchestration health check and, if needed, automatically refreshes the Ruby control-plane once (using Docker cache) and continues startup. This is shown as informational messages in the console. If startup ultimately fails, check `~/monadic/log/docker_startup.log` (look for `Auto-rebuilt Ruby due to failed health probe`). You can tweak the health probe via `START_HEALTH_TRIES` and `START_HEALTH_INTERVAL` in `~/monadic/config/env`.
