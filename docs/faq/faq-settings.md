# FAQ: Setup and Settings

**Q**: Do I need an OpenAI API token to use Monadic Chat?

**A**: An OpenAI API token is not necessarily required if you do not use functions such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, and text embedding. You can also use APIs such as Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Cohere, Mistral AI, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and xAI Grok.

If you do not want to use commercial APIs, you can use the Ollama container to run local language models:
1. Build the Ollama container via Actions â†’ Build Ollama Container
2. Install models using an `olsetup.sh` script or let it download the default model (llama3.2)
3. Use the Chat app with Ollama provider selected

For detailed information on using Ollama with Monadic Chat, see [Using Ollama](/advanced-topics/ollama.md).

**Q**: Rebuilding Monadic Chat (rebuilding the containers) fails. What should I do?

**A**: Check the contents of the log files in the shared folder.

If you are developing additional apps or modifying existing apps, check the contents of `server.log` in the log folder. If an error message is displayed, correct the app code based on the error message.

If you are adding libraries to the Python container using `pysetup.log`, error messages may be displayed in `docker_build.log`. Check the error message and correct the installation script.

**Q**: I get "container not found" or similar Docker errors when using the packaged app. What should I do?

**A**: This is typically caused by Docker Compose project name inconsistencies. Monadic Chat uses the project name "monadic-chat" for all container operations. To resolve:

1. Stop all Monadic Chat containers: `docker compose -p "monadic-chat" down`
2. List any orphaned containers: `docker ps -a | grep monadic`
3. Remove orphaned containers if found: `docker rm [container_id]`
4. Restart Monadic Chat from the application

The application now ensures consistent use of the project name to prevent this issue.
