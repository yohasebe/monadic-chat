# JupyterLab Integration

Monadic Chat has a feature to launch JupyterLab. JupyterLab is an integrated development environment (IDE) for data science and machine learning. By using JupyterLab, you can perform data analysis and visualization using programming languages such as Python and R.

## Launching JupyterLab

Click the `Actions/Start JupyterLab` menu in the Monadic Chat console to launch JupyterLab. JupyterLab can be accessed at `http://localhost:8888`.

When JupyterLab is launched, it starts with `/monadic/data` as the home directory. This allows you to access files in the shared folder within JupyterLab.

## Stopping JupyterLab

To stop JupyterLab, close the JupyterLab tab or click the `Actions/Stop JupyterLab` menu in the Monadic Chat console.

## Using JupyterLab App

In the basic JupyterLab app of Monadic Chat, you can do the following through chat with the AI agent:

- Start and stop JupyterLab
- Create new notebooks in the shared folder
- Load notebooks from the shared folder
- Add new cells to notebooks
