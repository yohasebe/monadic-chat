Enter a message in the text area and click the `Send` button to send the message. To use voice input, click the `Voice Input` button to start voice input, and click the `Stop` button to end voice input. The voice is converted to text via the Whisper API and displayed in the text area.

?> To chat smoothly with the AI agent using voice input and speech synthesis, it is convenient to turn on `Auto Speech` and `Easy Submit` in the web settings. These are enabled by default in the [Voice Chat](./basic-apps?id=voice-chat) app.

?> The `Role` selector is used to select the role of the message. Normally, select `User`, but by selecting `Assistant` or `System`, you can add or modify the context of the chat. For more information, see the [FAQ](./faq-user-interface).

# Uploading Images

Click `Upload Image` to select an image to attach to the message.

After uploading the image, image recognition is performed, and the AI agent provides information about the image according to the text prompt (some models do not support image recognition).

# Uploading PDFs

In Anthropic's Sonnet model, PDF uploads are supported in addition to images. Click `Upload Image/PDF` to select a PDF file to attach to the message.

As with images, when you upload a PDF file, the contents of the PDF are recognized, and the AI agent provides information about the PDF according to the text prompt.

To continue the conversation about the contents of the PDF in the chat, you need to upload the same PDF file with each message input. Once you upload a PDF during a session, Monadic Chat will send that PDF to the AI agent with each message until the session ends. If you have enabled `Prompt Caching` in the web settings, prompts for the same PDF will be cached, saving on API usage. To end the conversation about the PDF, click the delete `Ã—` button to clear the PDF.
