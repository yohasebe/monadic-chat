# Shared Folder

When you first start Monadic Chat, a `~/monadic/data` directory is created. This directory is the default shared folder for sharing files within Monadic Chat's Docker containers.

Clicking the `Shared Folder` button in the Monadic Chat console will launch the OS's standard file manager and open the shared folder.

By placing files in this directory, you can access those files within Monadic Chat's Docker containers. The path to the shared folder within each Docker container is `/monadic/data` while the path to the shared folder on the local machine is `~/monadic/data`.

In apps that can execute code (e.g., Code Interpreter app), you can read files from the shared folder. When specifying a file, only specify the file name without the directory.

During the execution of some process on the AI agent side (using function calling, for example), intermediate files may be saved in the shared folder. It is recommended to periodically check and delete unnecessary files.

When you use the `Actions/Start JupyterLab` menu in the Monadic Chat console to launch JupyterLab, it starts with `/monadic/data` as the home directory. This allows you to access files in the shared folder within JupyterLab as well.

## Examples of Files Saved in the Shared Folder

### System-Related Files

- `monadic.log`: Monadic Chat server log file
- `compose.yml`: Automatically generated file required for creating and starting additional containers

It is recommended not to manually delete these files.

### Files Generated by Basic Apps

- `code interpreter`: Intermediate files and result files generated by apps such as the Code Interpreter app
- `image generator`: Image files generated by apps
- `jupyter notebook`: Notebook files created by apps
- `video describer`: Image files generated by the app by splitting videos
- `video describer`: Audio files extracted by the app
- `speech draft helper`: Audio files generated by the app

## Structure inside the Shared Folder

When developing or adding additional apps other than the basic apps, you need to place the necessary files and folders in the shared folder. The following are subfolders that are automatically created inside the shared folder. For information on how to develop additional apps, see [Developing Apps](/developing-apps.md).

**`apps`**

A folder for storing additional applications other than the basic apps.

**`services`**

A folder for storing Docker-related files to create images and containers for use by additional applications.

**`helpers`**

A folder for storing helper files that contains functions (methods) to use in apps.

**`scripts`**

A folder for storing scripts that can be executed within the Python container (`monadic-chat-python-container`). Scripts stored here will be added to the Python container's path. Therefore, you can execute scripts using the `send_command` method in additional apps.

**`plugins`**

A folder for storing Monadic Chat plugins. Each plugin is organized in its own folder and can have its own `apps`, `helpers`, and `services` subfolders. Plugin folders cannot have a `scripts` subfolder.
