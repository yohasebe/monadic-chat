# Documentation, Implementation, and Test Consistency Report
Created: 2025-09-04

## Implemented Fixes

### âœ… Completed Items

1. **README.md**
   - Updated version notation from `v0.9.9+` to `v1.0.0-beta.4`
   - Removed specific numbers from test badge (changed to "tests-passing")
   - Added Perplexity provider limitations as a note

2. **New Documentation Created**
   - `/docs/reference/app-provider-matrix.md` - Detailed app-provider compatibility matrix
   - `/docs/reference/supported-languages.md` - Complete support list for 57 languages

3. **docs/basic-usage/basic-apps.md**
   - Fixed Math Tutor app supported providers (added Claude, Gemini, Grok)

4. **docs/_sidebar.md**
   - Added links to newly created documentation

## Discovered Inconsistencies

### ðŸ”´ High Priority

1. **Test Count Inconsistency**
   - CHANGELOG states "Test suite: 1253 examples"
   - Actual spec file count: 139 (Ruby) + 43 (JavaScript)
   - Errors occur during test execution, preventing accurate test count verification

2. **Default Model Inconsistency**
   - docs/reference/configuration.md: `OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL` default value is `gpt-5`
   - Same document's configuration example: uses `gpt-4o`
   - Needs verification against actual usage

3. **Docker Container Name Inconsistency**
   - Documentation: States `monadic-chat-ruby-container`
   - Actual: Ruby container not running (possibly in development mode)
   - Production environment verification needed

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority

4. **App Availability Table Incompleteness**
   - Partial mismatch between docs/basic-usage/basic-apps.md table and implementation
   - Math Tutor: Fixed
   - Detailed verification recommended for other apps

5. **MDSL Format Description**
   - docs/advanced-topics/develop_apps.md: States Ruby class format "not supported"
   - Implementation: Some `*_tools.rb` files use class definitions
   - Need to verify consistency between actual behavior model and documentation

6. **Provider Tool Calling Limitations**
   - Perplexity: Does not support tool calling
   - This limitation not consistently explained across all documentation

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority

7. **Language Support Details**
   - CHANGELOG: States 57 language support
   - Already detailed in newly created documentation

8. **Error Format Unification**
   - CHANGELOG: States unified across all 8 providers
   - Implementation: Shows "Progressive migration", complete unification unconfirmed

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Action Recommended

1. **Test Environment Fix**
   - Resolve RSpec dry-run errors
   - Verify actual test count and update CHANGELOG

2. **Default Model Verification**
   - Confirm if GPT-5 is appropriate as default
   - Align configuration.md examples with actual usage

3. **Docker Container Name Unification**
   - Verify container names in production environment
   - Align documentation with actual names

### Medium-term Action Recommended

4. **Complete App Availability Matrix Verification**
   - Verify implementation files for all apps
   - Fully synchronize basic-apps.md and app-provider-matrix.md

5. **Clarify MDSL and Ruby Class Usage Guidelines**
   - Document current implementation patterns
   - Clearly specify recommended and deprecated patterns

6. **Centralized Provider Limitation Management**
   - Manage each provider's limitations in one place
   - Provide consistent information across all documentation

## Confirmed Consistency Items

âœ… Basic architecture (Docker/Ruby/Electron)
âœ… WebSocket communication mechanism
âœ… MDSL specification and implementation
âœ… MCP integration explanation
âœ… Language settings and support
âœ… Most configuration options

## Summary

Overall, the documentation reflects the implementation well, but several important inconsistencies were discovered. Particularly for the test environment and default model settings, immediate verification and fixes are recommended.

While many major inconsistencies have been resolved with these fixes, continuous maintenance is necessary.
