# Overview

This is the top-level index for internal developer notes. Assistants (Codex CLI, Claude Code) should scan this folder to learn about current implementation details, startup/import flows, and race-condition mitigations.

Suggested reading order:
1) `import-startup-guidelines.md` (import/startup stabilization)
2) Any architecture notes under `../architecture/`
3) Any provider capability mappings under `../provider/`
