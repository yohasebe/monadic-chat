# Timeline Diagram

> Timeline: This is an experimental diagram for now. The syntax and properties can change in future releases. The syntax is stable except for the icon integration which is the experimental part.

"A timeline is a type of diagram used to illustrate a chronology of events, dates, or periods of time. It is usually presented graphically to indicate the passing of time, and it is usually organized chronologically. A basic timeline presents a list of events in chronological order, usually using dates as markers. A timeline can also be used to show the relationship between events, such as the relationship between the events of a person's life." Wikipedia

### An example of a timeline.

```mermaid-example

    title History of Social Media Platform
    2002 : LinkedIn
    2004 : Facebook
         : Google
    2005 : Youtube
    2006 : Twitter
```

         : Google

## Syntax

The syntax for creating Timeline diagram is simple. You always start with the `timeline` keyword to let mermaid know that you want to create a timeline diagram.

After that there is a possibility to add a title to the timeline. This is done by adding a line with the keyword `title` followed by the title text.

Then you add the timeline data, where you always start with a time period, followed by a colon and then the text for the event. Optionally you can add a second colon and then the text for the event. So, you can have one or more events per time period.

```json
{time period} : {event}
```

or

```json
{time period} : {event} : {event}
```

or

```json
{time period} : {event}
              : {event}
              : {event}
```

NOTE: Both time period and event are simple text, and not limited to numbers.

Let us look at the syntax for the example above.

```mermaid-example
timeline
    title History of Social Media Platform
    2002 : LinkedIn
    2004 : Facebook : Google
    2005 : Youtube
    2006 : Twitter
```

```mermaid
timeline
    title History of Social Media Platform
    2002 : LinkedIn
    2004 : Facebook : Google
    2005 : Youtube
    2006 : Twitter
```

In this way we can use a text outline to generate a timeline diagram.
The sequence of time period and events is important, as it will be used to draw the timeline. The first time period will be placed at the left side of the timeline, and the last time period will be placed at the right side of the timeline.

Similarly, the first event will be placed at the top for that specific time period, and the last event will be placed at the bottom.

## Grouping of time periods in sections/ages

You can group time periods in sections/ages. This is done by adding a line with the keyword `section` followed by the section name.

All subsequent time periods will be placed in this section until a new section is defined.

If no section is defined, all time periods will be placed in the default section.

Let us look at an example, where we have grouped the time periods in sections.

```mermaid-example
timeline
    title Timeline of Industrial Revolution
    section 17th-20th century
        Industry 1.0 : Machinery, Water power, Steam <br>power
        Industry 2.0 : Electricity, Internal combustion engine, Mass production
        Industry 3.0 : Electronics, Computers, Automation
    section 21st century
        Industry 4.0 : Internet, Robotics, Internet of Things
        Industry 5.0 : Artificial intelligence, Big data,3D printing
```

```mermaid

    title Timeline of Industrial Revolution
    section 17th-20th century
        Industry 1.0 : Machinery, Water power, Steam <br>power
        Industry 2.0 : Electricity, Internal combustion engine, Mass production
        Industry 3.0 : Electronics, Computers, Automation
    section 21st century
        Industry 4.0 : Internet, Robotics, Internet of Things
        Industry 5.0 : Artificial intelligence, Big data,3D printing
```

As you can see, the time periods are placed in the sections, and the sections are placed in the order they are defined.

All time periods and events under a given section follow a similar color scheme. This is done to make it easier to see the relationship between time periods and events.

## Wrapping of text for long time-periods or events

By default, the text for time-periods and events will be wrapped if it is too long. This is done to avoid that the text is drawn outside the diagram.

You can also use `<br>` to force a line break.

Let us look at another example, where we have a long time period, and a long event.

```mermaid-example
timeline
        title England's History Timeline
        section Stone Age
          7600 BC : Britain's oldest known house was built in Orkney, Scotland
          6000 BC : Sea levels rise and Britain becomes an island.<br> The people who live here are hunter-gatherers.
        section Bronze Age
          2300 BC : People arrive from Europe and settle in Britain. <br>They bring farming and metalworking.
                  : New styles of pottery and ways of burying the dead appear.
          2200 BC : The last major building works are completed at Stonehenge.<br> People now bury their dead in stone circles.
                  : The first metal objects are made in Britain.Some other nice things happen. it is a good time to be alive.
